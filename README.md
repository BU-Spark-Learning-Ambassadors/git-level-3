# Git Level 3

In this challenge, you will demonstrate advanced Git skills by managing a collaborative project, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a clean repository history. Follow the instructions found in the repository to complete this level.

## Requirements

In order for the project to be considered "completed", it must complete the following requirements:

### Git Repository Management

1. **Initial Setup:** Initialize a Git repository, create a README.md file, and commit it with a meaningful message.
2. **Branching and Merging:** Create a feature branch, make changes, and merge it into the main branch.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Introduce a conflict, resolve it, and commit the resolution.

### Collaborative Development

1. **Forking and Cloning:** Fork a provided repository, clone it to your local machine, and configure the upstream remote.
2. **Pull Requests:** Submit a pull request from your feature branch to the main branch of the original repository.

## Submission

After completing part 3, you are expected to create a [PR (pull request)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request). Once this is completed, you will follow this [template](https://github.com/hajiix/git-level3/issues/1) to create an Issue in this Git Level 3 repo.

It may take Learning Ambassadors up to 1-2 weeks to grade your solution and give any feedback/badges associated with this challenge. However, if it takes longer than 2 weeks, please send an email to sparkttl@bu.edu.
